# AI Tool Usage

## Tools used
- ChatGPT: project planning, code snippets, tests and README templates.
- GitHub Copilot: small autocompletions during development.

## Significant contributions
- Project structure and starter code skeleton (src/rentbuy/*) were generated with AI assistance and manually adapted.
- Unit-test templates and CLI examples were drafted with AI help and reviewed manually.

## Learning moments
I used AI to understand Monte Carlo design choices and to improve unit testing. I verified and modified all AI-provided code to ensure I understand every line.
